# 💼 LaTeX Resume

This is a professional resume built using LaTeX. It features a clean layout, modular sectioning, and easy customization. Each part of the resume (e.g., skills, experience, education) is separated into individual files for better organization.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `main.tex` — Main LaTeX file.
- `styles.tex` — Contains all the formatting and custom commands.
- `contents/` — Folder containing each section of the resume:
  - `heading.tex`
  - `skills.tex`
  - `experience.tex`
  - `projects.tex`
  - `education.tex`
  - `achievements.tex`
  - `certifications.tex`

## ✍️ How to Use

Open the `main.tex` file in a LaTeX editor like Overleaf or TeXShop, and edit the contents inside `contents/` as needed. Compile the `main.tex` file to generate your PDF resume.
